# ML-ClimateStatementSorting
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model designed to discern public sentiment surrounding climate change. By anlyzing online discourse, the model should ascertain whether people believe climate change is caused by human activity.

The resultant insights may hold significant value for various stakeholders and should facilitate more effective measurement of public opinion on the topic.
